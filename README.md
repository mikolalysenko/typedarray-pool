[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/mikolalysenko/typedarray-pool.png)](http://travis-ci.org/mikolalysenko/typedarray-pool)

# Example

```javascript
var pool = require("typedarray-pool")

//Allocate a buffer with at least 128 floats
var f = pool.malloc(128, "float")

// ... do stuff ...

//When done, release buffer
pool.free(f)
```

# Install

    npm install typedarray-pool

# API

```javascript
var pool = require("typedarray-pool")
```

### `pool.malloc(n[, dtype])`
Allocates a typed array (or ArrayBuffer) with at least n elements.

* `n` is the number of elements in the array
* `dtype` is the data type of the array to allocate.  Must be one of:

  + `"uint8"`
  + `"uint16"`
  + `"uint32"`
  + `"int8"`
  + `"int16"`
  + `"int32"`
  + `"float"`
  + `"float32"`
  + `"double"`
  + `"float64"`
  + `"arraybuffer"`
  + `"data"`
  + `"uint8_clamped"`
  + `"buffer"`

**Returns** A typed array with at least `n` elements in it.  If `dtype` is undefined, an ArrayBuffer is returned.

**Note**  You can avoid the dispatch by directly calling one of the following methods:

* `pool.mallocUint8`
* `pool.mallocUint16`
* `pool.mallocUint32`
* `pool.mallocInt8`
* `pool.mallocInt16`
* `pool.mallocInt32`
* `pool.mallocFloat`
* `pool.mallocDouble`
* `pool.mallocArrayBuffer`
* `pool.mallocDataView`
* `pool.mallocUint8Clamped`
* `pool.mallocBuffer`

### `pool.free(array)`
Returns the array back to the pool.

* `array` The array object to return to the pool.

**Note** You can speed up the method if you know the type of array before hand by calling one of the following:

* `pool.freeUint8`
* `pool.freeUint16`
* `pool.freeUint32`
* `pool.freeInt8`
* `pool.freeInt16`
* `pool.freeInt32`
* `pool.freeFloat`
* `pool.freeDouble`
* `pool.freeArrayBuffer`
* `pool.freeDataView`
* `pool.freeUint8Clamped`
* `pool.freeBuffer`

### `pool.clearCache()`
Removes all references to cached arrays.  Use this when you are done with the pool to return all the cached memory to the garbage collector.

# Why did you write this?

When you are frequently reusing temporary typedarrays in calculations, it gets expensive to initialize them to zero (especially if the result
is just going to get overwritten immediately anyway). If you pool the typed arrays, you don't pay this cost and you get the advantage of
reusing hot-in-cache memory for various operations.

This is also valuable in simulations/games that need to avoid large garbage collection pauses. Pooling memory significantly helps with this.
